This app created by Muhammad Baraa Karazeh for a non-governmental charity organization called Everyone Can Get Rich. This app titled Simple Interest Calculator, will compute the interest one can earn given the amount you wish to save, the number of years you can keep it with the bank and the interest rate the bank would pay you.

PS: this app is only for educational purpose as an assignment for the second course of the IBM fullstack cloud developer.
